Analyzing the Relationship Between Highly-Rated Movies and Social Media Activity

Objective: The study will explore whether higher rated movies create more online hype on social media platforms, such as Tumblr and Reddit. 
The study will look at the correlation between an IMDb rating (pulled from the OMDb API) and the associated amount of social media activity 
related to those films, via posts, likes, comments and upvotes from users.

Data Sources & Key Features:    
Tumblr: Number of posts containing a hashtag of a movie, which indicates the discussion's volume.Average likes for the top 10 posts, denoting interest and engagement from the users.
Reddit: Number of threads discussing a movie, especially noting movie-related subreddits (i.e. r/movies, r/TrueFilm).
        Upvotes and comments for the respective posts, denoting engagement with the user and the length of the discussion.     
OMDb API: IMDb ratings, which will act as the primary indicator of audience reception.              
Number of user reviews, which will determine the audience's level of engagement.

Expected Results:The hypothesis is that movies with the highest IMDb ratings, will result in more social media hype, namely, through increased posts, comments, and activity across both 
Reddit and Tumblr. 

Methods: Collect the data from Reddit and Tumblr to determine the amount of postings and activity by users on some movies.

Obtain IMDb ratings and review counts from OMDb API for the same movies.Analyze correlations between social media activity metrics and film ratings to determine patterns and trends. 

Expected Outcome: The analysis should reveal whether highly rated movies consistently generate more buzz, engagement, and conversation on social media websites.
